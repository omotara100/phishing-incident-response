## Timeline of Events
| Time (UTC) | Event |
|----------|------|
| 09:14 | Phishing email received |
| 09:20 | User reported email |
| 09:30 | Initial analysis completed |
| 10:00 | IOCs identified and enriched |
| 10:30 | Detection rule created |

## Incident Analysis
The phishing email used urgent language and impersonated IT Support to pressure the user into clicking a malicious link. The sender domain did not match the corporate domain, and the URL led to a credential harvesting page.

No user interaction with the link was confirmed, and no credentials were submitted.
