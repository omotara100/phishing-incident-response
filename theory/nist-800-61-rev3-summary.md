# NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3 – Incident Handling Guide

**NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 3** is the **Computer Security Incident Handling Guide**, providing a structured framework for organizations to **prepare for, detect, analyze, respond to, and learn from security incidents**.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Incident Lifecycle
The guide organizes incident handling into four main stages:

- **Preparation**
  - Establish policies, procedures, and roles
  - Ensure tools and logging are in place
  - Train the team for incident handling
- **Detection & Analysis**
  - Identify potential incidents via alerts or user reports
  - Confirm and classify incidents (e.g., phishing, malware)
  - Assess severity and business impact
  - Document findings and maintain a timeline
- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**
  - Limit the damage
  - Remove threats and restore systems
- **Post-Incident Activity**
  - Review the incident and lessons learned
  - Update playbooks, policies, and detection rules

---

### 2. Detection & Analysis
- Differentiate **alerts vs confirmed incidents**
- Categorize incident types (e.g., phishing, malware, credential compromise)
- Evaluate severity: Low / Medium / High
- Identify and document **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- Maintain an accurate **timeline of events**

---

### 3. Evidence Handling
- Collect relevant evidence:
  - Logs, email headers, URLs, IP addresses, file hashes
- Maintain integrity and chain of custody
- Ensure documentation supports investigation and future detection

---

### 4. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- Map attacker behaviors to standardized MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Examples for phishing incidents:
  - **T1566.001 – Spearphishing Attachment**
  - **T1204.002 – User Execution**

---

### 5. Communication & Escalation
- Escalate incidents based on severity and impact
- Maintain clear documentation for management and audits
- Facilitate coordination between SOC, IT, and management teams

---

## 🎯 Practical Takeaways
- Focus on **phishing incident detection and analysis**
- Collect evidence and document IOCs systematically
- Maintain clear incident documentation
- Map attacker actions to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Apply the framework as a **repeatable, structured workflow**
